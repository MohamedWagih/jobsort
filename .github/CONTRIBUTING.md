## Adding New Companies

Thank you for considering adding a new company to the list of companies that Jobsort indexes.
This is done in the `companies.csv` file.

The format of the file is as follows, `url,name,size,stage`:

*   `url`: This is the homepage of ther startup without the `www.` prefix.
*   `name`: Prefer the official name of the company in its correct casing.
*   `size`: One value from `sizes.txt`.
*   `stage`: One value from `stages.txt`.

If it's unclear what size or stage a company is in, please look up the company on [Crunchbase](https://www.crunchbase.com).

And also, please make sure there are no spaces around commas.
